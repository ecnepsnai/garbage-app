# Garbage App

The Garbage App was an app developed to assist with a research study into reducing the amount of
recyclable materials and organic waste being sent to landfills from a multi-family dwelling.

The app was designed to specifically assist with the cataloging of waste during a waste analysis
study.

longer needed for any purpose. As such, this repository will be marked as "Read Only" or "Archived".

so, but know that I will not provide any support in the form of bugfixes.
